# SafeGround: Know When to Trust GUI Grounding Models via Uncertainty Calibration

This repository contains the **official implementation of SafeGround**, an uncertainty-aware framework for reliable and risk-controlled GUI grounding under limited model access.

SafeGround estimates *spatial uncertainty* by aggregating multiple stochastic grounding predictions into a patch-level probability distribution, and calibrates uncertainty thresholds with finite-sample guarantees. This enables risk-aware deployment of GUI agents through selective prediction and safe deferral.

## Uncertainty Quantification Pipeline

**Pipeline:**
**Stochastic Coordinates → Patch Heatmap → Spatial Regions → Uncertainty Score**

Given multiple stochastic grounding samples, SafeGround constructs a spatial probability distribution over a patch grid, identifies coherent high-probability regions, and computes region-level uncertainty measures that capture different failure modes of GUI grounding.

## Risk Control via FDR Calibration

SafeGround calibrates an uncertainty threshold on a held-out calibration set to control the **False Discovery Rate (FDR)** of accepted predictions.

### Clopper–Pearson Upper Confidence Bound

Given (w) observed errors among (m) accepted samples, the FDR upper bound is computed as:

```
r_upper = Beta.ppf(1 - α, w + 1, m - w)
```

The largest threshold whose upper bound does not exceed the target risk level is selected for deployment.

### Reported Metrics

| Metric            | Description                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `threshold`       | Calibrated uncertainty threshold           |
| `power`           | Fraction of correct predictions retained   |
| `abstention_rate` | Fraction of predictions rejected           |
| `upper_bound`     | Clopper–Pearson FDR upper confidence bound |
